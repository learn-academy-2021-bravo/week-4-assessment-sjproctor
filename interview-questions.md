4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP data being the most important vs functions being the most important
  Tenants of OOP
  - encapsulation - scope should not bleed
  - abstraction - inner workings should stay inside
  - polymorphism - parent classes should be the least specific and reusable
  - inheritance - relationships between classes

  Tenants of Functional Programming:
  - pure function - the same input should always produce the same output
  - immutability - structure of persistent storage should not be updated
  - function as the most important thing you can create in your code
  - type systems - avoid type coersion
  - referential transparency - if you replaced a function with its output the code should not change
